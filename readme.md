# DotFiles

The default configurations are always conservative and disables many tools
which can improve produtivity. In this package, many configurations that were
found to be useful through these years are shared and enabled by default so
that new comers can improve their learning curve to the command line.  Everyone
is invited to help in this task so that users can make the most of the dark
terminal (yes, b/c dark terminals rulez!) world.

Mainly, three major command line behaviors will be changed: the shell
interpreter itself will be set to the Z shell, whereas most of the systems use
bash as default shell; the command line editor 'vim' will be installed with lua
support and many plugins will be enabled by default; and add some better
configuration for the screen command.

The user previous configuration, when existent, will be copied to
~/DotFiles/backups folder and can be restored by simply replacing the links
created by DotFiles to the old files.
